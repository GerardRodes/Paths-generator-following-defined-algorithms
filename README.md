It draws.

## Serious description
JS script which generates a table depending on the input and draws a path following the algorithm (not really an algorithm, lol) selected.

### Todo list
- [ ] Fix some graphic bugs pretty annoying with some paths
- [ ] Code an algorithm to build a **Maze**

#### Interesting points -> You can:
* switch the algorithm while executing one
* define your own algorithms in var `path` at `utils.js`
